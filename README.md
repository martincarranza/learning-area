# My learning-area
Github repo I haved forked from the [MDN Learning Area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn).

Most of the code examples shown and discussed in the Learning Area can be found here, where I have added to them as I go through the modules; the directories in the repo match the module structure of the articles.

The one exception is the [Server-side website programming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side) examples â€” Per MDN, these are in separate repos to make them easier to deal with:

* https://github.com/mdn/express-locallibrary-tutorial
* https://github.com/mdn/django-locallibrary-tutorial
